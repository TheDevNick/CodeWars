/* 
Your task is to add a new property usersAnswer to every object in the array questions. The value of usersAnswer should be set to null. The solution should work for array of any length.

For example:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's Pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0
}];
After adding the property the result should be:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0,
    usersAnswer: null
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0,
    usersAnswer: null
}];

P: function takes in array
R: function returns the array with the usersAnswer property added
E: see above
P: - create a function 
    - loop through the questions array 
    - add a usersAnswer property to each object in the array
    - set that property to null
    - return the array

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's Pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0
}];

function addPropertyToObject(array) {
    array.forEach(item => {
        item.usersAnswer = null
    })
    return array
}


console.log(addPropertyToObject(questions))
console.log(questions[0].usersAnswer === null)
